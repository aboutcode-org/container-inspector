notes: os_release contains the /etc/os-release file from many Linux distros.
    /etc/os-release is a standard Linux file used to identify the OS, os 
    release, and similar distros. It's now a standard file in systemd distros, 
    and in just about every Linux distro nowadays.
    Why collect them?
    The fields in /etc/os-release are standardized, but the values are not.
    The only way to know that Redhat Enterprise Linux is 'rhel' or that openSUSE 15
    is 'opensuse-leap' is to install the distros and check the file. This repo is a
    large collection of os-release files so you don't need to install each and every
    distro that are used here as test files.
